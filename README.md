# jxlgui

jxlgui is a Windows Desktop App designed to make the conversion of images to the JPEG XL format straightforward and accessible to everyone. With JPEG XL, you can enjoy modern image format benefits such as impressive performance and lossless compression. This tool stands out by offering a portable single executable file, making it easy to use without a complex installation process.

## Motivation

The motivation behind developing jxlgui was to increase the accessibility of the JPEG XL file format. We believe in the potential of JPEG XL to revolutionize image storage and transmission, and we want to contribute to its adoption by providing a user-friendly tool for image conversion.

## Key Features

- **Portable**: jxlgui comes as a single executable file, requiring no installation.
- **Batch Conversion**: Easily add multiple images to the app for batch conversion.
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Simply drag and drop your files into the app's drop area to start the conversion process.
- **Supports Multiple Formats**: The input can be PNG, APNG, GIF, JPEG, PPM, PFM, or PGX, and a JPEG XL (JXL) file will be converted to PNG with ICC, JPG, or PPM/PFM.

## Installation

No installation is required! Just copy the executable file to a convenient location on your computer and run it. jxlgui is built with .NET 8.0, so ensure your system meets the same requirements as .NET 8.0 for smooth operation.

## Usage

Using jxlgui is as simple as dragging and dropping your image files into the app's drop area. For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the screenshots and video tutorials included in this README.
